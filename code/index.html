     Elephants are the largest mammals that live on land. The largest animals live in Africa. Their weight can reach 12 tons, their height is more than three meters, and their body length is more than 7 meters. One of the main features of an elephant is a long trunk, which is a fused upper lip with a nose. The trunk is a universal organ that allows the elephant to get food, collect water for drinking and bathing, lift and carry various objects, and also helps to capture odors. Another feature of elephants is their large ears. In elephants, the ears perform the function of thermoregulation. They are permeated with a dense network of blood vessels, and when blood passes through these vessels, it cools, and then returns to other organs and cools them. Elephants have a very good ear, they can even distinguish some melodies.

     Zebra is an animal that is a close relative of wild horses, donkeys, tapirs and rhinos. The name was borrowed from the natives and does not have an exact meaning. Today there are three species of this animal and the quagga, which was completely destroyed by man. Zebras are not as fast as horses, but if necessary they can reach speeds of up to 85 km / h. During the pursuit, the zebra begins to run in zigzags in order to confuse the enemy. This tactic makes the animal a difficult prey, which many predators refuse after a few minutes of chase.
